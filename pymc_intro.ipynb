    "Probabilistic programming (PP) allows flexible specification of Bayesian statistical models in code. PyMC is an open-source PP framework with an intuitive and readable, yet powerful, syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. It features next-generation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman, 2014), a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC; Duane, 1987). This class of samplers works well on high dimensional and complex posterior distributions and allows many complex models to be fit without specialized knowledge about fitting algorithms. HMC and NUTS take advantage of gradient information from the likelihood to achieve much faster convergence than traditional sampling methods, especially for larger models. NUTS also has several self-tuning strategies for adaptively setting the tunable parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which means you usually don't need to have specialized knowledge about how the algorithms work. \n",

    "### Example: Parametric Survival Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival models are used to estimate expected event times, often in biomedical settings. Survival data is characterized by the presence of censoring, where subject drop out of the study system before the event of interest occurs, or the study ends before events occur to all subjects. There are two components to the model likelihood: one that describes the observed events, and the other that describes the censoring (the fact that the event occurs sometime after the last observation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example models the survival of cancer patients, using metastization (`X`) as a covariate and censoring (`censored`) as a binary indicator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with pm.Model() as weibull_model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Survival covariates\n",
    "    beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0., sigma=10., shape=2)\n",
    "    eta = beta.dot(X.T)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Observation noise\n",
    "    s = pm.HalfNormal(\"s\", 5.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Survival function\n",
    "    y_obs = pm.Gumbel(\"y_obs\", eta[~censored], s, observed=y_std[~censored])\n",

    "For our purposes, its not important to undestand the details of survival modeling (the topic of entire university courses!). I'm using this example because it includes all of the building blocks of Bayesian models, as implemented in PyMC. "

A deterministic like `eta` is defined by a mathematical function that returns its value given values for its parents. Deterministic variables are sometimes called the *systemic* part of the model. The nomenclature is a bit confusing, because these objects usually represent random variables; since the parents of `eta` are random, `eta` is random also.\n",

First, we have created a `Model` object; a `Model` is a Python object that encapsulates all of the variables that comprise our theoretical model, keeping them in a single container so that they may be used as a unit. After a `Model` is created, we can populate it with all of the model components that we specified when we wrote the model down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `Model` above was declared using a `with` statement. This expression is used to define a Python idiom known as a **context manager**. Context managers, in general, are used to manage resources of some kind within a program. In this case, our resource is a `Model`, and we would like to add variables to it so that we can fit our statistical model. The key characteristic of the context manager is that the resources it manages are only defined within the indented block corresponding to the `with` statement. PyMC uses this idiom to automatically add defined variables to a model. Thus, any variable we define is automatically added to the `Model`, without having to explicitly add it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, `Model` is a tape machine that records what is being added to the model; it keeps track the random variables (observed or unobserved) and other model components. The model context then computes some simple model properties, builds a **bijection** mapping that transforms between Python dictionaries and numpy/Aesara ndarrays. , More importantly, a `Model` contains methods to compile Aesara functions that take Random Variables--that are also initialised within the same model--as input.\n",
