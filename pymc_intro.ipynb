    "Probabilistic programming (PP) allows flexible specification of Bayesian statistical models in code. PyMC is an open-source PP framework with an intuitive and readable, yet powerful, syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. It features next-generation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman, 2014), a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC; Duane, 1987). This class of samplers works well on high dimensional and complex posterior distributions and allows many complex models to be fit without specialized knowledge about fitting algorithms. HMC and NUTS take advantage of gradient information from the likelihood to achieve much faster convergence than traditional sampling methods, especially for larger models. NUTS also has several self-tuning strategies for adaptively setting the tunable parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which means you usually don't need to have specialized knowledge about how the algorithms work. \n",

    "Since the earliest days of the sport, baseball pitchers have applied foreign substances on the ball to help them throw better pitchers. But while it has always been against the rules, is was rarely enforced. In the early days, pine tar was used to allow for a harder grip on the ball, which in turn allows the ball to be spun at a higher rate. Eventually, this evolved to a sticky blend of rosin (powder derived from pine tree sap) and sunscreen. The resulting high spin rates resulted in fewer hits and more strikeouts, and finally led  MLB to a mid-season crackdown in 2021, handing out 10-game suspensions to any pitcher caught using \"sticky stuff\":\n",

In its simplest form, this is a piecewise-constant model, with an early and late population mean, separated by a discrete changepoint. The challenge here is that we want to assume that the changepoint is unknown, use the data to estimate its location, and then see whether the estimated changepoint is consistent with the change in enforcement.\n",

    "At the model-specification stage (before the data are observed), $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$, $\\tau$ and $\\sigma$ are all random variables. Bayesian \"random\" variables have not necessarily arisen from a physical random process. The Bayesian interpretation of probability is **epistemic**, meaning random variable $x$'s probability distribution $p(x)$ represents our knowledge and uncertainty about $x$'s value. Candidate values of $x$ for which $p(x)$ is high are relatively more probable, given what we know. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can generally divide the variables in a Bayesian model into two types: **stochastic** and **deterministic**. The only deterministic variable in this model is $r_t$. If we knew the values of $r_t$'s parents, we could compute the value of $r_t$ exactly. A deterministic like $r_t$ is defined by a mathematical function that returns its value given values for its parents. Deterministic variables are sometimes called the *systemic* part of the model. The nomenclature is a bit confusing, because these objects usually represent random variables; since the parents of $r_t$ are random, $r_t$ is random also.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, even if the values of the parents of $\\mu_1$, for example, were known, we would still be uncertain of its value. Such variables are stochastic, characterized by probability distributions that express how plausible their candidate values are, given values for their parents.\n",

The key characteristic of the context manager is that the resources it manages are only defined within the indented block corresponding to the `with` statement.
